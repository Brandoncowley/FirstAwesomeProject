# Project 1
# Activity Selector
â€‹
For our first group project, we were given the task of collaboratively creating an interactive webpage that will call on multiple APIs to create a functional, useful web application. Requirements were that we use a framework other than Bootstrap, deliver a polished UI, and be intuitive for the user to quickly understand the purpose of the site itself.

In completing this project, we now have an application that can take the mental work out of choosing an activitiy to participate in. A user can visit our site, readily understand how to use the site, and pull a random activity out of 9 genres.

In building this page and designing it, we had three areas to work with - first was to learn a new framework outside of Bootstrap - we chose Materialize upon the recommendation of a couple of instructors. Second was to accurately call and implement two different APIs and display their data into the site itself. Lastly, we had to collaboratively learn how to use GitHub with multiple branches and coordinate our activity so as not to disrupt our progress.

As a group, we all were able to grow our skillsets, build on our knowledge of GitHub and code formatting, and communicate in a constructive way!
